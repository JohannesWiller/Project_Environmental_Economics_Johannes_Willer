# Project_Environmental_Economics_Johannes_Willer

 This is the project submission for the course advanced environmental economics for Johannes Willer!

 The general idea of this repository is:
 1. Run the normal DICE (MimiDICE2016R2) model
 2. Replicate the GroDICE model
 3. Introduce endogenous technological growth in the DICE model
 4. Introduce endogenous technological growth in the GroDice model

 I will compare the results of the 4 Models in my Paper, which is also provided in this repository. My motivation is to create a more realistic Dice Model and thereby make a more realistic forecast about the impacts of climate change.
